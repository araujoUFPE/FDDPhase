dTruncCauchy(x, param)

\arguments{
\item{x}{Equivalent to \code{sample=psi}, is the array describing the support of the
phase at which the pdf.}

\item{mu}{loc: Floating point tensor; the modes of the corresponding
non-truncated Cauchy distribution(s).}

\item{sigma}{scale: Floating point tensor; the scales of the distribution(s).
Must contain only positive values.}

\description{
The truncated Cauchy is a Cauchy distribution bounded between
             low a nd high (the pdf is 0 outside these bounds and renormalized).
             Samples from this distribution are differentiable with respect to
             loc and scale, but not with respect to the bounds low and high
}
\details{
The truncated Cauchy distribution has the same density, with a
         different proportionality constant, over a finite interval. It's a
         well-behaved distribution, with a mean, variance, and any other
         moment you might care about.
